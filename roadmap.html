      <p>Deciding on an organization's marketing campaign requires great planning and preparation, which needs info from the company comes first in the planning, including the product, business theme, and budget.
      </p>
      <p>One must conduct market basic market research and identification to determine how to begin marketing. The team or business owner can conduct this to provide information about the target audience, target market, consumer preference, and eve product research as they are all important.
      </p>
      <p>To go into more depth on analyzing the market, research on how the company operates, how the market operates, and how the product is classified are now specific and can change how one markets their products. For example, if a company has a marketing mix of more than three products that relate to each other, ads can be optimized to target these products and not just the main one. This service can be paid for by clients to improve ad campaigns, but can also be skipped if step two is satisfactory.
      </p>
      <p>Deciding the marketing method and marketing strategy can now commence. The problem is if adjustments are needed to be made in the future processes of the marketing campaign, then both time and effort are wasted. So, this process needs to be finalized and structured perfectly. Fortunately, the employers will help in understanding what form and what theme the campaign will take, with the business goals in mind. Price varies depending on what the client wants from the staff.
      </p>
      <p>The overall theme of the possible advertisement will now be specified to focus on effective design to attract consumers. This includes colors, mood, tone, font, and even pacing of the campaign. This will also determine brand style and reputation.
      </p>
      <p>The finalizing phase begins. To make sure no mistakes are made, checking the info and comparing it to the data gathered is a requirement in the marketing industry. The removal of excess info and filler content to filter out for more effective campaigns will be done after.</p>
      <p> Include other clients and staffs perspective from consultations and opinions.</p>
      <p>The process of making the marketing campaign finally begins. This may take two weeks to even a month depending on the amount of material needed. However, it can take just days to a few weeks if individual marketing advertisements are given one by one. The price is also determined by effort and time rather than just quality.</p>
      <p>Before providing the product to the client, checks are made ont only by rechecking all content and comparing it to the data, but also by letting other departments check to ensure no bias (including the Director). The client can also ask for revisions if really needed, but only for valid reasons will it be free of charge.</p>
      <p>If revisions are to be made, a valid reason must be presented as well as an outline of the needed changes. Invalid excuses include but are not limited to: Misplaced info, change of market, change of theme, and change of form as these should have been finalized already. Payment could be made for revisions still.
